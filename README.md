### What is this repository for? ###

* Src code and issues regarding jactor-rises

This project is created as microsevices and not as a monolithic client/server applications and are loosely described on this page using [GitLab Flavoured Markdown](https://gitlab.com/help/user/markdown)

The only hard dependencies between jactor modules are:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    jactor.rises.commons-->jactor.rises.facade;
    jactor.rises.commons-->jactor.rises.model;
    jactor.rises.commons-->jactor.rises.persistence.orm;
    jactor.rises.commons-->jactor.rises.web;
    jactor.rises.model->jactor.rises.facade;
```

### Set up ###

* spring-boot applications are created when building (`mvn install`)
    * `jactor-persistence-orm` which is a standalone rest application which handles the persistence on a database using an object relational model and `spring-data-jpa`
    * `jactor-facade` is a rest applications which handles io from any interaction with/from `jactor-model`
    * `jactor-web` which is a web application on apache tomcat
* these applications can run side by side to get a full working web-application (using `mvn spring-boot:run` on each application)
* `jactor-persistence-orm` is using h2 (in-memory database), and is not finite
* after started `jactor-web`, point a browser to http://localhost:8080/jactor-web/

### Disclaimer ###

These applications are not 100% finished, but created for my own learning. That is to say:

* `Blog`s are only persisted in `jactor-persistence-orm` and only have an integration test of the rest api that verifies actual interactions.
* `GuestBook`s have interactions from `jactor-model` and are tested with an integration test, but lack interactions from `jactor-web`.
* `User` (with `Person` and `Address`) is fully integrated with communications from `jactor-web`, which use `jactor-model` and `jactor-persistence-orm` (through `jactor-facade`).
  * Note! Not all services for a `User` on `jactor-persistence-orm` is used.
* Persistence in `jactor-persistence-orm` is not satisfactory. There is therefore [an issue](https://github.com/jactor-rises/jactor-rises/issues/1) (help wanted) created for solving a potential "buggy" solution.

### Architecture Summary ###

There are three microservices in this architecture which all handles all of the technical infrastructure needed for performing the business logic of the model:

* `jactor-web` handles all user interaction
* `jactor-persistence-orm` handles persistence of the data
* `jactor-facade` handles all communication between `jactor-model` and the other microservices
  * this microservice has the actual business logic (`jactor-model`) and this a hard dependency to the service. This single jar-file is therefore free of code regarding infrastructure and can solely focus on the business rules to handle.
